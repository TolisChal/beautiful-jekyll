#### *Abstract*

Volume computation of convex polytopes and sampling algorithms are very useful in many scientific fields
and applications. The VolEsti is a C++ software package for volume approximation and scales to a few
hundreds dimensions in contrast to currently available packages. Thus it could be an essential tool for
a quite large number of scientific applications that need fast volume approximation or sampling in high
dimensions. The goal of this project is to provide a friendly and efficient interface of VolEsti in a high
level language as R. Second to propose additions that might be useful for some scientific applications,
especially in economics and in biogeography and control, by extending VolEsti. Furthermore this new R package
would provide necessary tools for some other future extensions that could be used in applications in biology
and optimization problems. We hope this project will be a decisive contribution towards the first complete
and efficient tool for geometrical statistics and thus, help educational programs, research or even serve
as a building block towards an international, interdisciplinary community in geometrical statistics.

##### *1st week*  
Working together with my mentors on the algorithic part of the project and especially on Volume computation for Zonotopes. Here are some important papers for our work: 
* Zonotopes and the LP-Newton method [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11081-008-9067-x)
* Goffin's Algorithm for Zonotopes [here](https://dml.cz/bitstream/handle/10338.dmlcz/143088/Kybernetika_48-2012-5_5.pdf)
* Methods for order reduction of Zonotopes [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8264508/)
