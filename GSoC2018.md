#### *Abstract*

Volume computation of convex polytopes and sampling algorithms are very useful in many scientific fields
and applications. The VolEsti is a C++ software package for volume approximation and scales to a few
hundreds dimensions in contrast to currently available packages. Thus it could be an essential tool for
a quite large number of scientific applications that need fast volume approximation or sampling in high
dimensions. The goal of this project is to provide a friendly and efficient interface of VolEsti in a high
level language as R. Second to propose additions that might be useful for some scientific applications,
especially in economics and in biogeography and control, by extending VolEsti. Furthermore this new R package
would provide necessary tools for some other future extensions that could be used in applications in biology
and optimization problems. We hope this project will be a decisive contribution towards the first complete
and efficient tool for geometrical statistics and thus, help educational programs, research or even serve
as a building block towards an international, interdisciplinary community in geometrical statistics.

#### *Bonding period*

  
* ##### *1st week*  
Working together with my mentors on the algorithmic part of the project and especially on Volume computation for Zonotopes. Here are some important papers for our work: 
* Zonotopes and the LP-Newton method [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11081-008-9067-x)
* Goffin's Algorithm for Zonotopes [here](https://dml.cz/bitstream/handle/10338.dmlcz/143088/Kybernetika_48-2012-5_5.pdf)
* Methods for order reduction of Zonotopes [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8264508/)

[Here](https://opencobra.github.io/cobratoolbox/stable/tutorials/tutorialUniformSampling.html) you can see an application (not included in the proposal) in biology that needs uniform sampling from zonotopes.
  
* ##### *2nd week*
Working on the main algorithm of the project: We study state-of-the-art volume computation algorithms, as Ben Cousin's and Santosh Vempala's [cooling gaussian](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.6011) algorithm, and reschedule the deliverables in order to implement them as well. The main advantages are (a) better time efficiency, (b) less code and neccesary R and C++ packages and (c) more choices and flexibility for the user depending the problem.

The cooling gaussian algorithm takes some fundamental ideas from Lovasz's-Vemapla's [LV](http://web.cs.elte.hu/~lovasz/vol4-focs-tr.pdf) algorithm. A practical version of a combination of these two algorithms is given [here](http://mpc.zib.de/index.php/MPC/article/view/178/99) with very encouraging results. Comparing with VolEsti (or an improved version of VolEsti) is an important issue.

The final goal is an application with a variety of choices depending on the problem, the dimension, the sample distribution requested and the type of the convex body.

* #### *3rd week*
Setting up the project environment at [github](https://github.com/TolisChal/volume_approximation/tree/develop). Everuthng is ready for the coding period!  
We made the following changes to the Deliverables - time schedule:  

* After we complete the Part I of the project we are going to implement Cousin's and Vempala's algorithm for the general convex body case.
* We have to write new classes for the ellipsoid.
* We are not going to need any SOCP solver.
* We have to modify the RCHR function in order to get a new point in each step and sample from the gaussian distribution.
* We are going to need a new function for the ScheduleAnnealing.
