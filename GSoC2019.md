#### *Abstract*

Sampling algorithms and volume computation of convex polytopes are very useful in many scientific fields and applications. The package [volesti](https://github.com/GeomScale/volume_approximation) is a C++ package with an R interface which provides three geometric random walks for sampling and two state-of-the-art methods for volume estimation for convex polytopes being the first package providing such a variety of options in geometric statistics. volesti currently scales to a few hundreds dimensions in contrast to other available R packages, as [geometry](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geometry/index.html), or C++ package [VINCI](https://www.math.u-bordeaux.fr/~aenge/index.php?category=software&page=vinci) that both only scale typically up to 15-20 dimensions. Thus it could be an essential tool for a quite large number of scientific applications in convex analysis, economics, biology or statistics, that need fast volume approximation or sampling in high dimensions. However, the possibility to scale from a few hundred to a few thousand dimensions was considered as a very far-reaching goal for many years. The goal of this project is to provide the first ever implementations for sampling and volume computation for convex polytopes in a few thousand dimensions. We exploit some very recent theoretical results that guarantee fast convergence and numerical stability in order to propose an efficient implementation of the current state-of-the-art geometrical random walks, i.e. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Vaidya walk. The proposed implementations will be a decisive contribution to other scientific fields as computational geometry, finance and optimization. We hope this project will be a decisive contribution towards the first complete and efficient tool for sampling, volume estimation and geometrical statistics in general and thus, help educational programs, research or even serve as a building block towards an international, interdisciplinary community in geometrical statistics.

#### *Bonding period*

* ##### *1st week*  
I have created [4 Pull Requests](https://github.com/GeomScale/volume_approximation/pulls) in github repository of `volesti` package, to add the implementations of my preliminary work for the GSoC proposal:  
1. [Check if the requested error is positive](https://github.com/GeomScale/volume_approximation/pull/14).
2. [Dikin walk implementation](https://github.com/GeomScale/volume_approximation/pull/16).
3. [Boundary sampling](https://github.com/GeomScale/volume_approximation/pull/15) with Hit-and-Run.
4. [Volume computation and sampling for low dimensional convex polytopes](https://github.com/GeomScale/volume_approximation/pull/17).

* ##### *2nd - 3rd week*
I have read some papers that are retated to the coding project. In particular, we discussed methods given in:

#### *Coding period*  

* ##### *1st week*  
1. I have created a [new branch](https://github.com/TolisChal/volume_approximation/tree/HMC_sampling) in my repo at github to implement Remannian Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. I have started coding.  
2. I have extracted the system of non linear equations from the ODE in [1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06243).  
3. I have implemented Newton method to solve the system of non linear equations.

* ##### *2nd week*
1. I implement polynomial interpolation to compute the tranjectory that lies in the convex polytope in order to define a larger walk step than the theoretical result suggests in [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06261).
