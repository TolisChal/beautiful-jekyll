* #### *TODO List* [here](https://github.com/TolisChal/volume_approximation/issues/4)  
   
* #### *Further work*  
 - Create the final version of the R package after mentor's evaluation and submit it to CRAN.  
 - Continue working on V-polytopes' volume approximation by improving parts of the current algorithms, i.e. V-polytope membership by using [CppOptimizationLibrary](https://github.com/PatWie/CppNumericalSolvers) library. Test new ideas and methods for V-polytopes.  
 - Extend current implementation to non-linear convex and non-convex bodies.  
 - Add implementations of financial applications for crisis prediction and financial modeling, describing [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05861).  
 - Add more sampling options, i.e. different random walk algorithms or sampling from the boundary of a convex body.
